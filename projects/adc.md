<p>This group project involved designing and manufacturing Air Data Computer, that would be able to measure:</p>

<ul class="list-disc">
  <li>Altitude</li>
  <li>Indicated Air Speed</li>
  <li>True Air Speed</li>
  <li>Vertical Speed</li>
  <li>Air Temperature</li>
</ul>

<p class="my-2">Designed ADC would be connected to PC using serial connection. Then, using special software, data would be recorded and plotted.</p>

<p class="my-2">I was the person responsible for the development of the software.</p>

<p class="my-2">App was written using C# and Winforms. It is capable of:</p>
<ul class="list-disc">
  <li>displaying measurements (using graphical gauges)</li>
  <li>displaying graphs</li>
  <li>saving received data to a .csv file</li>
</ul>
